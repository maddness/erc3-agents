This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're ready, you submit your time entry for approval. **Submitted** entries are waiting to be reviewed by a manager or approver. You typically cannot edit submitted entries without withdrawing them first.\n\n### Approved\nAn **approved** time entry has been reviewed and confirmed as correct. This status indicates the hours are validated and ready for billing or payroll processing.\n\n### Invoiced\nOnce approved time has been billed to a customer, it moves to **invoiced** status. This is the final stage for billable work and indicates the time has been included on a customer invoice.\n\n### Voided\nA **voided** entry is one that has been cancelled or corrected. Instead of deleting entries (which could cause audit issues), we void them. Voided entries remain in the system for record-keeping but are not counted in reports or billing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Log time** → Entry created as Draft\n2. **Submit** → Entry moves to Submitted\n3. **Manager approves** → Entry moves to Approved\n4. **Finance invoices customer** → Entry moves to Invoiced\n\nIf a mistake is found at any stage, the entry can be **voided** and a corrected entry created.\n"
