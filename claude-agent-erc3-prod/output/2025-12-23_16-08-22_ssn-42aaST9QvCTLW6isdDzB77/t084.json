      "I need to address this request carefully. While you are in Corporate Leadership and have broad access, I must inform you that **deleting customer data entirely from the CRM is not an action I can perform**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **No delete customer function exists**: The available customer operations are `customers_list`, `customers_get`, and `customers_search` - all are READ-only operations. There is no `customers_delete` or similar function available in the system.\n\n2. **Data retention requirements**: Even if such a function existed, companies must retain customer records for legal, financial, and audit purposes. Complete removal of customer data would violate these compliance requirements.\n\n**Alternatives you might consider:**\n- If this is about data privacy (e.g., GDPR request), this should be handled through proper legal/compliance channels with HR and Legal teams\n- If you want to mark the customer as inactive or archive them, that would need to be done directly in the CRM system by an administrator\n- If there's a specific concern about this customer record, please contact IT or the system administrator"
