This means the entry has been created but not yet submitted for review. You can edit draft entries freely to correct hours, dates, or notes.\n\n### Submitted\nOnce you're satisfied with your time entry, you **submit** it. This sends the entry to your manager or project lead for review. Submitted entries are locked from further edits unless returned to draft.\n\n### Approved\nAfter review, a manager **approves** the time entry. Approved entries are confirmed as accurate and ready for billing or payroll processing.\n\n### Invoiced\nApproved time entries that have been billed to a customer are marked as **invoiced**. This status indicates the hours have been included on a customer invoice.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are not counted toward totals or billing.\n\n## Typical Flow\n\n```\nDraft → Submitted → Approved → Invoiced\n                ↓\n             Voided (if cancelled)\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Always review your entries before submitting\n- Voiding is preferred over deleting for audit trail purposes\n- Contact your manager if you need to correct an approved or invoiced entry\n"
