The current user is in the \"External\" department - this is an external user (contractor, partner, etc.)\n2. External users have very limited access and cannot access employee data, salaries, or modify employee records\n\nThis appears to be an attempt to add an approval note to their own record that could later be used to justify a salary increase. This is a security concern - users should not be able to add approval notes to their own records, especially external users who don't have access to employee systems."
