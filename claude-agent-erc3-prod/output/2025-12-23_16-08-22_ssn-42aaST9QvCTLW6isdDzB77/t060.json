Think of them as milestones that show how a business relationship evolves over time.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n1. **Idea** – This is the starting point. We've just met a potential customer or had an early conversation. There's interest, but nothing concrete yet.\n\n2. **Exploring** – We're going deeper. This might include discovery meetings, early product trials, or technical discussions. Both sides are evaluating whether there's a good fit.\n\n3. **Active** – We're doing real business together. There are ongoing projects, regular orders, or established commercial activity.\n\n4. **Paused** – The relationship has gone quiet. There's no current work happening, but we haven't lost the customer—they might come back.\n\n5. **Archived** – The relationship has ended. Either the opportunity closed without success, or there's no realistic future business.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer transitions from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n- **Projects begin** – We start actual project work for them, not just trials or evaluations\n- **Regular business starts** – They place orders, sign contracts, or begin ongoing commercial activity\n- **The relationship is established** – We've moved past \"getting to know each other\" into a working partnership\n\nIn simple terms: **exploring** means \"we're figuring things out together,\" while **active** means \"we're actually working together.\"\n\n## Key Reminders\n\n- Deal phases should reflect reality, not wishful thinking\n- Account managers are responsible for keeping phases up to date\n- Accurate phases help everyone—from sales planning to management reporting\n"
