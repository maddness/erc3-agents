To rename - transfer content to new location and zero out old page.\n- The IT & Digital team maintains the **technical infrastructure** and integrates the wiki with the chatbot.\n\n## Relation to other systems\n\n- The wiki is **not** a replacement for transactional data (e.g. CRM entries, project records, time logs).\n- Instead, it documents:\n  - How to use systems.\n  - Why certain processes exist.\n  - What standards and best practices apply.\n\nThe chatbot can search the wiki to answer “how” and “why” questions, and it can link directly to articles when relevant.\n\n## Good practices\n\n- Keep pages **short, focused and up to date**.\n- Use clear headings and bullet points.\n- Add **links** to related pages and systems where helpful.\n- Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.\n"
