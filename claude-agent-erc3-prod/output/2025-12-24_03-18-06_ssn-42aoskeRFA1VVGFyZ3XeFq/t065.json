          "content": "# Time Entry Status Overview\n\nThis guide explains the different statuses a time entry can have in our system.\n\n## Status Lifecycle\n\n### Draft\nA time entry starts as a **draft**. This means the entry has been created but is not yet finalized. You can still edit draft entries freely—change hours, dates, or notes as needed.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're confident your time entry is accurate, you **submit** it for review. Submitted entries are waiting for manager or project lead approval. Avoid making changes at this stage unless asked.\n\n### Approved\nOnce a manager reviews and approves the entry, it becomes **approved**. This confirms the work was done as recorded. Approved entries are ready for billing and should not be modified.\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved time is included on a customer invoice, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This status indicates the time has been billed. These entries are locked and cannot be changed.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for record-keeping but are excluded from reports and billing. To correct a voided entry, create a new entry with the correct information.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Status | Editable? | Billable? | Purpose |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Draft | Yes | Not yet | Work in progress |\n| Submitted | Limited | Pending | Awaiting approval |\n| Approved | No | Ready | Confirmed work |\n| Invoiced | No | Billed | Included on invoice |\n| Voided | No | No | Cancelled entry |\n\n## Tips\n\n- Always review your draft entries before submitting\n- If you spot an error after approval, contact your project lead\n- Voided entries cannot be recovered—create a new entry instead\n"
