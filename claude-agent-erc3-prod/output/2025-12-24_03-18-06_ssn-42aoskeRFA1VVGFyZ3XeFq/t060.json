They help everyone understand where a customer stands in their journey with Bellini Coatings – from first contact to ongoing business (or departure).\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nA brand new lead. We've just identified them – maybe at a trade fair, through a referral, or from an inbound inquiry. The customer has been added to the CRM, but we're still in very early conversations.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nWe're having deeper discussions. This might include:\n- First site visits\n- Basic technical discussions\n- Early lab suggestions or product recommendations\n- Initial trials or samples\n\nThink of this as the \"getting to know each other\" phase.\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is where real business happens. The customer has:\n- Formal projects opened in the project registry\n- Trials, custom formulations, or supply schemes underway\n- Significant internal time being logged against their projects\n\nThese are customers we're actively working with on a regular basis.\n\n### 4. Paused\nThe relationship isn't dead, but there's no current activity. Maybe the customer's project got delayed, or they're waiting for budget approval. We keep them in the system and stay in touch.\n\n### 5. Archived\nThe relationship is effectively closed. Either we lost the opportunity, the customer went elsewhere, or there's no realistic future business. The record stays for historical reference.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer transitions from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is created** in the project registry – this is the key trigger\n2. **Significant work begins** – lab work, field tests, or technical collaboration\n3. **Internal time starts being logged** against the customer and their projects\n\nIn simple terms: **when we stop just talking and start actually doing work together**, that's when they become \"active.\"\n\nThe account manager is responsible for updating the deal phase, typically during or after pipeline review meetings. The goal is always to reflect the *true state* of the relationship, not wishful thinking.\n\n---\n\n*This guide is based on our CRM and sales process documentation.
