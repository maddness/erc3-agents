This means it has been created but not yet submitted for review. You can edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you submit a time entry, it moves to **submitted** status. This indicates the entry is ready for manager review. Once submitted, changes require manager involvement.\n\n### Approved\nAn **approved** entry has been reviewed and confirmed by a manager. Approved entries are considered final for internal reporting purposes.\n\n### Invoiced\nWhen approved time has been billed to a customer, the entry becomes **invoiced**. This status locks the entry to ensure billing records remain accurate and consistent.\n\n### Voided\nA **voided** entry has been cancelled. Use this status to correct mistakes instead of deleting records. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and billing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. Log your time → **Draft**\n2. Submit for approval → **Submitted**\n3. Manager reviews → **Approved**\n4. Finance bills customer → **Invoiced**\n\nIf an error is found at any stage, the entry can be **voided** and a corrected entry created.\n"
