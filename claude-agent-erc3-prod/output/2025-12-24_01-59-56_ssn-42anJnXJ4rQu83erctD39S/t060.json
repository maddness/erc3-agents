          "content": "# Deal Phases in Our CRM – A Plain-Language Guide\n\nThis guide explains how deal phases work and when to move a customer from one phase to another.\n\n## What Are Deal Phases?\n\nDeal phases track where a customer relationship stands in our sales process. Every customer in the CRM has a deal phase that reflects the **true state of the commercial relationship** – not wishful thinking, but reality.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\n**What it means:** A brand-new lead or early conversation.\n\n**When to use:** You've just met someone at a trade fair, received a referral, or got an inbound enquiry. You've added them to the CRM with a brief note, but nothing concrete has happened yet.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Exploring\n**What it means:** Deeper exploration and early trials are underway.\n\n**When to use:** The relationship has moved beyond initial contact. You might be:\n- Visiting the customer's site\n- Discussing their specific requirements\n- Running lab tests or field trials\n- Creating a project in the registry to track the opportunity\n\n---\n\n### 3. Active\n**What it means:** Ongoing projects and regular business.\n\n**When to use:** The customer has become a real, working relationship. This typically means:\n- Trials have been successful\n- Pricing and terms have been agreed\n- You're supplying product or providing ongoing support\n- There's regular business activity (orders, technical service, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Paused\n**What it means:** No current activity, but the relationship isn't lost.\n\n**When to use:** Things have gone quiet – maybe the customer's project was delayed, budgets were frozen, or they're busy with other priorities. You're not actively working together right now, but there's realistic potential to restart.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Archived\n**What it means:** Relationship closed or no realistic future business.\n\n**When to use:** The opportunity is over. Perhaps they chose a competitor, went out of business, or it's clear there's no fit. Move them here to keep your pipeline clean.\n\n---\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nThe transition from **exploring** to **active** happens when you move from \"trying things out\" to \"doing real business together.\"\n\n**Key signals that it's time to switch:**\n\n1. **Trials are complete and successful** – Lab work and field tests have confirmed the product works for their application.\n\n2. **Commercial terms are agreed** – Pricing, volumes, and service levels have been negotiated and accepted.\n\n3. **Regular orders or projects begin** – You're actually supplying product or delivering services, not just testing.\n\n4. **Ongoing support kicks in** – Technical service, quality, and logistics are involved in a sustained way.\n\n**In simple terms:** If you're still figuring out whether this will work, stay in 'exploring'. Once you're actually working together on a regular basis, move to 'active'.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nKeeping deal phases accurate helps everyone:\n- **Management** gets realistic pipeline views\n- **Finance** can forecast properly\n- **The chatbot** gives trustworthy answers about customer status\n- **You** have a clean, honest view of where things stand\n\nWhen in doubt, be realistic – it's better to have an accurate pipeline than an optimistic one.\n"
