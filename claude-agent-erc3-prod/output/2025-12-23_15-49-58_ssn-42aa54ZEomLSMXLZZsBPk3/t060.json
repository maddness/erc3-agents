          "content": "# Deal Phases in Our CRM - A Plain Language Guide\n\nThis document explains how deal phases work in our CRM system and when customers move between phases.\n\n## What Are Deal Phases?\n\nDeal phases track the overall state of our commercial relationship with each customer. They help everyone understand where we stand with a customer at a glance - from a brand new lead to an established, active business relationship.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nThis is where every customer relationship starts. A new lead comes in - maybe from a trade fair, a referral, or an inbound enquiry. At this stage, we're having early conversations to understand if there's potential for business.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nThe relationship is getting more serious. We've moved past initial conversations and are now in deeper exploration mode. This typically involves:\n- Site visits by account managers (sometimes with technical sales engineers)\n- Feasibility assessments (volumes, application methods, regulatory requirements)\n- Early trials and lab work\n- Creating projects in our project registry\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is the goal! The customer has become regular business. We have ongoing projects, regular orders, and an established working relationship. When a customer reaches this phase, it means:\n- Negotiations were successful\n- We're actively supplying products\n- Technical service and support are engaged\n- Time is being logged against real projects\n\n### 4. Paused\nSometimes business slows down. A customer in \"paused\" status isn't actively ordering or working with us right now, but the relationship isn't over. They might return when:\n- Their projects resume\n- Market conditions change\n- They have new requirements\n\n### 5. Archived\nThe relationship has effectively ended. Either we've mutually parted ways, the customer has closed, or there's simply no realistic future business. Archived customers stay in the system for historical records but aren't part of active pipeline reviews.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when the exploratory work turns into real, ongoing business. The key triggers are:\n\n1. **Successful trials** - Lab tests and field trials have worked out\n2. **Agreement reached** - Pricing, volumes, and service levels have been negotiated and agreed\n3. **Regular business begins** - Orders are being placed and fulfilled\n4. **Implementation phase starts** - We're actively supplying and supporting the customer\n\nIn practical terms: if we're past the \"let's see if this works\" stage and into \"we're doing business together regularly,\" that's when exploring becomes active.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- **Be realistic** - Deal phases should reflect the true state of the relationship, not wishful thinking\n- **Keep it updated** - Account managers are responsible for maintaining accurate phases\n- **It's the source of truth** - The CRM is where everyone (including our chatbot) goes to understand customer status\n\n---\n*This is a draft document explaining CRM deal phases for internal reference.*\n"
