This means it's saved but not yet finalized. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n**Submitted**\nOnce you're confident your time entry is correct, you submit it for review. Submitted entries are waiting for manager or finance approval.\n\n**Approved**\nAn approved entry has been reviewed and confirmed as accurate. Approved entries are ready to be included in client invoices.\n\n**Invoiced**\nThis status means the time has been billed to the customer. Invoiced entries are locked and cannot be changed.\n\n**Voided**\nIf an entry was made in error, it can be voided. Voided entries are cancelled and won't be billed. They remain in the system for audit purposes but don't count toward project hours.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. Log your time → **Draft**\n2. Review and submit → **Submitted**\n3. Manager approves → **Approved**\n4. Finance bills client → **Invoiced**\n\nIf there's an error at any stage, use **Voided** to cancel the entry and create a corrected one.\n"
