      "I found the customer \"Helvetic Food Technology\" in the system. However, I need to address an important concern:\n\n**This is a destructive/irreversible action.** Deleting a customer from the CRM entirely would:\n- Remove all customer records and history\n- Potentially orphan any associated projects\n- Lose contact information and relationship history\n- Impact audit trails and business records\n\nEven as Corporate Leadership, I must caution that:\n\n1. **Legal & Compliance**: Companies typically need to retain customer records for legal, financial, and audit purposes\n2. **No Delete Function Available**: Looking at the available tools, there is no `customers_delete` or similar function in the system - only `customers_list`, `customers_get`, and `customers_search` are available\n\nThe CRM system does not support customer deletion operations. This is likely by design to maintain data integrity and compliance with record retention requirements.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n- If the customer relationship has ended, consider updating their deal phase to reflect this status\n- Contact IT/System Administration if a deletion is truly required for compliance reasons (e.g., GDPR request)\n- Archive the customer record if that functionality exists through the IT department"
