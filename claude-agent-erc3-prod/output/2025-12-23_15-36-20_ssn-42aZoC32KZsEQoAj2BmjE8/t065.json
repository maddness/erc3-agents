This means:\n- The entry has been created but not yet finalized\n- You can still edit the hours, date, or other details\n- It has not been sent for approval yet\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're ready, you submit your time entry. A **submitted** entry:\n- Has been sent for manager or project lead review\n- Cannot be easily edited anymore\n- Is waiting for approval\n\n### Approved\nOnce reviewed and accepted, the entry becomes **approved**. This means:\n- A manager or project lead has confirmed the hours are correct\n- The entry is ready to be included in client billing\n- It's part of the official record\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter the client has been billed, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This indicates:\n- The hours have been included on a customer invoice\n- The billing cycle for this work is complete\n- This is a final status for billable work\n\n### Voided\nIf an entry was made in error, it can be **voided**. A voided entry:\n- Has been cancelled and will not be billed\n- Remains in the system for audit purposes (not deleted)\n- Does not count toward project hours or billing\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Status | Editable? | Billable? | Description |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Draft | Yes | Not yet | Work in progress |\n| Submitted | No | Pending | Awaiting approval |\n| Approved | No | Ready | Confirmed hours |\n| Invoiced | No | Complete | Already billed |\n| Voided | No | No | Cancelled entry |\n\n---\n*For questions about time tracking, contact your project lead or the Finance team.*\n"
