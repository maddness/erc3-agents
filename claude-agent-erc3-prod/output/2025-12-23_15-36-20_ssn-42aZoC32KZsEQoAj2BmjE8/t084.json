The system does not support customer deletion functionality.\n\n**Why this limitation exists:**\n- Customer records must be retained for legal, financial, and audit compliance purposes\n- Historical records of business relationships, contracts, and transactions need to be preserved\n- Even inactive or lost prospects may have associated data that requires retention\n\n**Alternatives:**\n1. If this customer relationship has ended, you could work with IT/Admin to mark the customer as \"inactive\" or \"closed\" in the deal phase\n2. If this was created in error, please contact IT or the system administrator who may have backend access to handle exceptional cases with proper documentation\n3. If there are data privacy concerns (e.g., GDPR request), this should be escalated to Legal and IT for proper handling\n\nWould you like me to help with any of these alternative approaches?",
