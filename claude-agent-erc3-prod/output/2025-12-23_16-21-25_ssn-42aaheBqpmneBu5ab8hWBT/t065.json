          "content": "# Time Entry Status Overview\n\nThis guide explains the different statuses a time entry can have in our system and what each one means.\n\n## Status Definitions\n\n### Draft\nA time entry starts as a **draft**. This means it has been created but not yet submitted for approval. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you **submit** a time entry, it goes to your manager or project lead for review. At this stage, you are confirming that the hours logged are accurate and ready for approval.\n\n### Approved\nAn **approved** time entry has been reviewed and confirmed by a manager or project lead. This validates that the work was completed as recorded. Approved entries are locked from further editing.\n\n### Invoiced\nOnce approved time entries are billed to the customer, they are marked as **invoiced**. This status indicates that the hours have been included on a customer invoice and are part of the billing record.\n\n### Voided\nA **voided** entry has been cancelled. Use this status to correct mistakes without deleting the record entirely. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but do not count toward totals or billing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Log time** → Entry created as Draft\n2. **Submit for approval** → Status changes to Submitted\n3. **Manager reviews** → Status changes to Approved\n4. **Finance bills customer** → Status changes to Invoiced\n\nIf an error is found at any stage, the entry can be voided and a corrected entry created.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Always review your draft entries before submitting\n- Once approved, entries cannot be edited—void and re-create if corrections are needed\n- Voided entries are kept for audit trail purposes\n"
