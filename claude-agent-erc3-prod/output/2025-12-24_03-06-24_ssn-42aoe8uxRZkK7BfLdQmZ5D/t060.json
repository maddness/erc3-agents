Exploring\n- **What it means:** We're in deeper discussions and possibly doing early trials\n- **Typical situation:** Account managers have visited the customer, had technical discussions, maybe done some lab work or product recommendations\n- **Activity level:** Getting to know each other, testing the waters\n\n### 3. Active\n- **What it means:** We have ongoing projects and regular business\n- **Typical situation:** Formal projects exist in the project registry, we're doing trials, custom formulations, or active supply\n- **Activity level:** Real work is happening; time is being logged\n\n### 4.
