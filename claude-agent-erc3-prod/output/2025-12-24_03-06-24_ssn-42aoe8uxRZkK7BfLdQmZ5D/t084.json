Even inactive customers need to be kept for historical reference, contract obligations, and compliance requirements.\n\n**Alternative options:**\n1. If the customer relationship has ended, you can work with HR/Finance to update the deal phase to reflect the current status (e.g., \"lost\" or \"inactive\")\n2. If there's a data quality issue (duplicate record, incorrect entry), please contact IT & Digital to investigate and properly reconcile the records\n\nWould you like me to help with any of these alternatives instead?",
