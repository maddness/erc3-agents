This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or correct draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're confident your time entry is accurate, you **submit** it. Submitted entries are ready for manager review. At this stage, the entry is locked from casual edits.\n\n### Approved\nOnce a manager reviews and accepts a submitted entry, it becomes **approved**. Approved entries are confirmed as accurate and ready for billing or payroll processing.\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved time has been billed to a customer, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This status indicates the time has been included on a customer invoice.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was made in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and billing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Log time** → Entry created as Draft\n2. **Submit** → Entry moves to Submitted\n3. **Manager approval** → Entry moves to Approved\n4. **Billing** → Entry moves to Invoiced\n\nIf an error is discovered at any point, the entry can be voided and a corrected entry created.\n"
