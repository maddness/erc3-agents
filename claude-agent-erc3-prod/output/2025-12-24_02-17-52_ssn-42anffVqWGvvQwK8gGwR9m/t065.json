This means it has been recorded but not yet finalized. Drafts can be freely edited or deleted by the employee who created them.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen an employee is confident their time entry is accurate, they **submit** it for review. Submitted entries are ready for manager approval and should not be changed unless rejected.\n\n### Approved\nA manager reviews submitted entries and **approves** them if they are correct. Approved entries are validated and ready for billing or payroll processing.\n\n### Invoiced\nOnce approved time has been billed to a customer, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This status indicates the work has been charged and the entry is part of financial records.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it is **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and billing calculations.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. Employee logs time → **Draft**\n2. Employee confirms and submits → **Submitted**\n3. Manager reviews and approves → **Approved**\n4. Finance bills the customer → **Invoiced**\n\nIf an error is found at any stage, the entry can be **Voided** and a corrected entry created.\n"
