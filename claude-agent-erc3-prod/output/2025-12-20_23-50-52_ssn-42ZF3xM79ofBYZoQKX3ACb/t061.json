We have approximately 150 employees across our locations in Italy (HQ between Milan and Bergamo), Serbia (Novi Sad), and EU sales offices in Munich, Paris, Rotterdam, Barcelona, and Vienna.\n\n**Regarding Time Tracking:**\nAs a future employee, you'll have access to our internal wiki and company systems once you officially join and receive your credentials. Our time tracking documentation and policies will be available to you through the internal knowledge base at that point.\n\nGenerally speaking, companies track time for several common reasons:\n- **Project costing** - understanding how much effort goes into each project\n- **Client billing** - for billable work on customer projects\n- **Resource planning** - knowing team capacity and workload\n- **Compliance and auditing** - maintaining accurate records\n\nFor Bellini-specific policies and procedures, please check with your HR contact or manager once you start, and they'll guide you to our internal documentation.\n\nIs there anything else about Bellini Coatings I can help you with before you join?",
