          "content": "# Time Entry Status Overview\n\nThis document explains the different statuses a time entry can have in our system and what each one means.\n\n## Status Lifecycle\n\nTime entries move through the following statuses:\n\n### 1. Draft\nA time entry starts as a **draft**. This is a work-in-progress entry that hasn't been finalized yet. You can edit or delete draft entries freely. Think of it as your personal notepad for tracking hours before you're ready to submit them.\n\n### 2. Submitted\nWhen you're confident your time entry is accurate, you **submit** it for review. Once submitted, the entry is locked from casual editing and is waiting for a manager or project lead to review it. If there's an error, the entry can be returned to draft status for corrections.\n\n### 3. Approved\nAfter review, a manager or project lead **approves** the time entry. This confirms that the hours logged are accurate and authorized. Approved entries are ready for billing and payroll processing. Changes at this stage require special authorization.\n\n### 4. Invoiced\nOnce the time has been included on a customer invoice, the entry moves to **invoiced** status. This creates a permanent record linking your logged hours to actual billing. Invoiced entries cannot be modified—they're part of the financial record.\n\n### 5. Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes, but they don't count toward billing or payroll. You cannot delete time entries entirely; voiding preserves the audit trail.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Status    | Can Edit? | Counts for Billing? | Description                     |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Draft     | Yes       | No                  | Work in progress                |\n| Submitted | Limited   | No                  | Awaiting approval               |\n| Approved  | No        | Yes                 | Confirmed and ready for billing |\n| Invoiced  | No        | Yes (billed)        | Included on customer invoice    |\n| Voided    | No        | No                  | Cancelled, kept for audit       |\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have questions about time entry statuses or need to correct an entry that's already been approved or invoiced, please contact your project lead or the Finance team.\n"
