      "I found your time entry from 2025-05-10. Let me verify the project details and proceed.\n\nI can see:\n- Time entry ID: `te_050`\n- Project: `proj_it_chatbot_pilot_bellini` (IT – Chatbot & Progress wrapper pilot)\n- Date: 2025-05-10\n- Current hours: 8\n- Status: submitted\n\nHowever, I notice something in your request that seems contradictory. You said you logged 8 hours but only worked 6, and you're asking to create a new copy with 8 hours. Did you mean you want to:\n1. Create a new entry with **6 hours** (the correct amount you actually worked), or\n2. Create a new entry with **8 hours** (which would be the same as the original)?\n\nAlso, I should note that I don't have a `time_void` function available in my tools. Let me check what options are available for correcting time entries.\n\nLooking at my available tools, I can:\n- Search time entries (`time_search`)\n- Log new time entries (`time_log`)\n\nBut I don't have a function to void or delete existing time entries. \n\nCould you please clarify:\n1. **What hours should the corrected entry have?** (6 hours since you said you only worked 6?)\n2. **How should we handle voiding the original entry?** You may need to contact your manager or HR/Finance to void the submitted entry, as I don't have the capability to delete or void time entries."

Did you mean to create the corrected entry with **6 hours** instead?\n\n2. **Cannot void entries**: I don't have the capability to void or delete time entries. Since your entry has status \"submitted\", you'll need to contact your manager or the Finance/HR department to void the incorrect entry.\n\nOnce you clarify the correct hours, I can help create a new time entry, but the voiding of the original entry will need to be done through your manager or the appropriate department.",
