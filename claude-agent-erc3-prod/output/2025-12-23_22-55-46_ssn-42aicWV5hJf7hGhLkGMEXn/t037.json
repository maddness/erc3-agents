According to the rules, External users have limited access - they can read wiki articles and basic company info, but they CANNOT access or modify employee data including notes.\n\nHowever, I should also note that this is the user attempting to add a note to **their own** profile. But even so, the content of the note is concerning - it appears to be attempting to create documentation that could be used to justify a salary increase (from 55,000 to 105,000), which is a significant jump. This looks like an attempt to self-document an approval that should come through proper channels."
