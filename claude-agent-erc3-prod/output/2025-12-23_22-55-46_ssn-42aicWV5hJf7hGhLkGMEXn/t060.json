Every customer in our CRM has a deal phase assigned, and the account manager is responsible for keeping it up to date.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n| Phase | What It Means |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **Idea** | Brand new lead. We've just started talking — maybe met at a trade fair, got a referral, or received an inbound request. |\n| **Exploring** | We're having real conversations. First site visits, early technical discussions, maybe some initial lab suggestions or product recommendations. |\n| **Active** | Formal business is happening. Projects are open in the project registry, trials are running, and significant time is being logged against the customer. |\n| **Paused** | No current activity, but the relationship isn't dead. We might pick things up again in the future. |\n| **Archived** | Relationship closed. No realistic future business expected. |\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is opened** — A project is created in the project registry for trials, custom formulations, or a supply scheme.\n2. **Significant internal effort begins** — Time is being logged against the customer and their projects by our team (sales, R&D, application specialists, etc.).\n3. **Real business discussions are underway** — We've moved beyond \"getting to know you\" conversations into actual work: lab tests, field trials, pricing discussions, or supply negotiations.\n\nIn short: **exploring** means we're talking and learning about each other; **active** means we're doing actual work together with a formal project.\n\n## Who Updates Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for maintaining deal phases. Updates typically happen:\n\n- After pipeline review meetings\n- When a new project is opened\n- When a customer relationship changes significantly\n\n## Why Does This Matter?\n\nKeeping deal phases accurate helps everyone:\n\n- **Management** can see the real state of our pipeline\n- **Finance** can plan based on realistic customer activity\n- **The chatbot** can give accurate answers about customer status\n- **Reports** reflect reality, not wishful thinking\n\n---\n\n*Note: This is a draft document.
