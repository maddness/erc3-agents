This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you submit a time entry, it goes to your manager or project lead for review. Submitted entries are pending approval and should not be modified unless returned to draft.\n\n### Approved\nAn approved entry has been reviewed and confirmed as correct. Approved entries are ready for billing and cannot be easily changed. If corrections are needed, the entry must typically be voided and re-entered.\n\n### Invoiced\nOnce time has been billed to the customer, it moves to invoiced status. These entries are locked and form part of our financial records.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry contains an error or needs to be cancelled, it can be voided. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and billing. To correct a voided entry, create a new time entry with the correct information.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Status | Can Edit? | Billable? | Notes |\n|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n| Draft | Yes | No | Work in progress |\n| Submitted | Limited | No | Awaiting approval |\n| Approved | No | Ready | Confirmed correct |\n| Invoiced | No | Billed | Customer charged |\n| Voided | No | No | Cancelled/corrected |\n\n## Need Help?\n\nContact your project lead or the IT & Digital team if you have questions about time tracking.\n"
