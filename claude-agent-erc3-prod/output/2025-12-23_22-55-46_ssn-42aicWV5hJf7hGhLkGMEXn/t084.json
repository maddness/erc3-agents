However, I cannot delete customer records from the system.\n\n**Reason:** The system does not support customer deletion functionality. This is by design - company records must be retained for legal, financial, and audit purposes (contracts, invoices, historical project data, compliance requirements).\n\n**Alternative options:**\n1. If this customer relationship is no longer active, we can update their deal phase to reflect that status\n2. Contact the IT & Digital or Finance & Administration department to discuss proper archival procedures\n3. If there's a data correction need (e.g., duplicate entry), this should be handled through a formal data governance process\n\nWould you like me to help with any of these alternatives instead?",
