Please void that time entry and create new copy with 8 hours.\"\n\nThis doesn't quite make sense - you're asking to:\n1. Delete the entry with 8 hours (because you only worked 6)\n2. Create a new entry with 8 hours (which is the same amount)\n\nDid you mean to create a new entry with **6 hours** instead of 8? That would match your correction.\n\nAlso, I should note that I don't have a function to **delete/void** time entries - I can only log new ones or search existing ones. The time tracking system doesn't appear to support voiding entries through my available tools.\n\nCould you please clarify:\n1. What should the **correct hours** be on the new entry? (6 hours, based on your description?)\n2. For voiding the existing entry, you may need to contact your manager or HR, as I don't have the capability to delete time entries."
