This means it has been recorded but not yet submitted for review. You can edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you submit a time entry, it moves to \"submitted\" status. This indicates the entry is ready for manager review. Once submitted, the entry is locked from casual editing.\n\n### Approved\nAfter a manager reviews and approves a submitted entry, it becomes \"approved.\" Approved entries are confirmed as accurate and ready for billing or payroll processing.\n\n### Invoiced\nOnce an approved entry has been included on a customer invoice, it moves to \"invoiced\" status. This is the final status for billable work and indicates the time has been billed to the customer.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry contains an error or needs to be cancelled, it can be voided. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are not counted toward totals or billing. Use this status to correct mistakes rather than deleting records.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Log time** → Entry created as Draft\n2. **Submit for review** → Status changes to Submitted\n3. **Manager approves** → Status changes to Approved\n4. **Finance invoices customer** → Status changes to Invoiced\n\nIf an error is discovered at any stage, the entry can be voided and a corrected entry created.\n"
