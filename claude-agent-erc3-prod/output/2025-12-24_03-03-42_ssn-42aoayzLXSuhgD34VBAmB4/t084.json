However, I cannot delete or remove customer records from the system.\n\n**Why this is not possible:**\n1. The system does not have a customer deletion function - this is by design to maintain data integrity and audit trails\n2. Customer records may be linked to projects, time entries, and other historical data that must be preserved for legal, financial, and compliance purposes\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- If you need to mark this customer as inactive, you could update the deal_phase or work with IT/Administration to archive the record through proper channels\n- If there's a data quality issue (duplicate record, incorrect entry), please contact IT & Digital or Finance & Administration to handle this through the appropriate data governance process\n\nWould you like me to help with any of these alternatives instead?",
