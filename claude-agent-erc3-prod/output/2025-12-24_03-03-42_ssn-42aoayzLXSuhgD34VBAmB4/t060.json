          "content": "# Deal Phases in the CRM – A Plain Language Guide\n\nThis document explains how deal phases work in our CRM system and when a customer relationship moves between stages.\n\n## What Are Deal Phases?\n\nDeal phases represent the current status of our commercial relationship with a customer. They help everyone understand where we stand with each customer – from first contact to ongoing business.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n1. **Idea** – This is where every customer relationship starts. We've just learned about a potential customer or had an early conversation. Think of it as \"we know their name and there might be something here.\"\n\n2. **Exploring** – We're now having deeper discussions. The customer is interested enough to learn more about what we can offer. This might include early product trials, technical discussions, or preliminary quotations. Both sides are evaluating whether there's a good fit.\n\n3. **Active** – This is where we want to be! The customer has ongoing projects with us and we're doing regular business together. They're buying our coatings and we're delivering value.\n\n4. **Paused** – The relationship has gone quiet. There's no current activity, but the door isn't closed. Maybe their project was delayed, or they're waiting for budget approval. We haven't lost them – things are just on hold.\n\n5. **Archived** – The relationship has ended. Either the customer chose a different supplier, went out of business, or there's simply no realistic future business. We keep the record for historical reference.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n- We start working on **actual projects** together (not just trials)\n- There is **regular, ongoing business** – not a one-time purchase\n- Real products are being delivered and used\n\nIn simple terms: **exploring** means \"we're figuring out if this will work,\" while **active** means \"we're doing business together.\"\n\n## Important Reminders\n\n- **Keep phases realistic** – Record the true state of the relationship, not wishful thinking\n- **Account managers are responsible** for keeping deal phases current\n- **Every active customer must be in the CRM** – no shadow customers in emails or spreadsheets\n\nAccurate deal phases help management understand our pipeline and enable the chatbot to give trustworthy answers about customer status.\n"
