Every customer in the CRM has a deal phase that reflects the real state of the relationship — not wishful thinking, but the actual situation.\n\n## The five deal phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nA brand-new lead. We've just met them — perhaps at a trade fair, through a referral, or from an inbound enquiry. There's potential interest, but no real engagement yet.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nWe're having real conversations. This means first site visits, technical discussions, early lab suggestions, or product recommendations. We're learning about each other, but nothing formal has started.\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is where the real work happens. The customer has moved beyond exploration — there are now formal projects in our project registry for trials, custom formulations, or supply arrangements. We're logging significant time against this customer. There's regular business happening.\n\n### 4. Paused\nThe relationship has gone quiet. There's no current activity, but we haven't lost them either. Perhaps their project was delayed, or their budget was cut. The door is still open.\n\n### 5. Archived\nThe relationship is closed. Either we lost the opportunity, or there's no realistic chance of future business. The customer record stays in the CRM for history, but we're not actively pursuing it.\n\n---\n\n## When does a customer move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\n**A customer moves from 'exploring' to 'active' when formal projects are opened in the project registry.**\n\nSpecifically, this happens when:\n\n1. **A project is created** — We've moved beyond informal conversations and have created an actual project for trials, custom formulation work, or a supply scheme.\n\n2. **Significant time is being logged** — Team members (sales, R&D, technical specialists) are tracking their work against the customer and related projects.\n\n3. **There's regular, structured engagement** — Not just occasional chats, but ongoing collaborative work with clear objectives.\n\nIn simple terms: **'Exploring' means we're talking. 'Active' means we're working.**\n\n---\n\n## Who maintains deal phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping the deal phase current. This typically happens after pipeline review meetings, when the team discusses where each customer relationship really stands.\n\n**Golden rule:** Update the phase to reflect reality. The CRM is the single source of truth — if the phase is wrong, reports are wrong, and the chatbot gives wrong answers.\n\n---\n\n## Quick reference\n\n| Phase | What it means | Typical activities |\n|-------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Idea | Just met them | Initial contact, CRM entry created |\n| Exploring | Learning about each other | Site visits, technical discussions, early recommendations |\n| Active | Working together | Formal projects, trials, logged time, regular business |\n| Paused | On hold | No current activity, but relationship intact |\n| Archived | Closed | No realistic future business |\n"
