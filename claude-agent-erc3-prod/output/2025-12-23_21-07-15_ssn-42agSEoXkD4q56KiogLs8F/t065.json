Draft\n- **What it means:** The entry has been created but is not yet finalized.\n- **Who can edit:** The employee who logged the time.\n- **Next step:** Submit for approval.\n\n### 2. Submitted\n- **What it means:** The employee has finished the entry and sent it for review.\n- **Who can edit:** Managers or approvers reviewing the submission.\n- **Next step:** Approve or return to draft for corrections.\n\n### 3. Approved\n- **What it means:** A manager has reviewed and confirmed the time entry is accurate.\n- **Who can edit:** Limited to administrative corrections only.\n- **Next step:** Include in customer invoicing.\n\n### 4. Invoiced\n- **What it means:** The time has been billed to the customer.\n- **Who can edit:** Cannot be modified (locked for accounting purposes).\n- **Note:** This is typically the final status for billable work.\n\n### 5. Voided\n- **What it means:** The entry has been cancelled and will not be counted.\n- **When to use:** To correct mistakes—void the incorrect entry and create a new one with the correct information.\n- **Note:** Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but do not affect totals.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Status | Editable? | Counts in Reports? | Billable? |\n|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|\n| Draft | Yes | No | Not yet |\n| Submitted | Limited | Pending | Not yet |\n| Approved | No | Yes | Ready |\n| Invoiced | No | Yes | Billed |\n| Voided | No | No | No |\n\n## Tips\n\n- Always review your entries before submitting.\n- If you made a mistake on an approved or invoiced entry, ask your manager to void it and create a corrected entry.\n- Voiding is preferred over deleting because it maintains a clear audit trail.\n"
