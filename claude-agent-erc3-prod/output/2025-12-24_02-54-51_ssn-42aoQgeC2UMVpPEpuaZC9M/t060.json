They help everyone understand where we stand with a customer at a glance – from first contact to long-term partnership.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n1. **Idea** – A new lead or early conversation. Someone has shown initial interest, but we're just getting started.\n\n2. **Exploring** – We're in deeper discussions with the customer. This typically includes site visits, feasibility assessments, and early trials or lab tests.\n\n3. **Active** – We have ongoing projects and regular business with the customer. This is a working relationship with actual orders or continuous engagement.\n\n4. **Paused** – There's no current activity, but the relationship isn't over. The customer may return when their situation changes.\n\n5. **Archived** – The relationship has ended or there's no realistic chance of future business.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n- **Trials have been completed successfully** – Lab tests and field tests on customer lines have proven our coating works for their application.\n- **A project transitions to implementation** – The customer has moved past the evaluation stage into actual supply and support.\n- **Regular business begins** – There are ongoing orders, a supply agreement, or continuous technical support in place.\n- **Real commitments exist** – Pricing, volume commitments, and service levels have been negotiated and agreed upon.\n\nIn short: **'Exploring' means we're still proving ourselves; 'Active' means we're doing business together.**\n\n## Who Manages Deal Phases?\n\n- **Account managers** are responsible for keeping deal phases up to date.\n- Phases should reflect the **true state** of the relationship, not wishful thinking.\n- **Sales & Customer Success** are the primary owners of customer records and phases.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAccurate deal phases are essential for:\n- Pipeline reviews and forecasting\n- Account prioritisation decisions\n- Meaningful reports for management\n- Enabling the chatbot to give accurate answers about customer status\n\n---\n\n*Keep it real: update deal phases when the relationship genuinely changes, not just when you hope it will.*\n"
