      "I need to inform you that **I cannot delete customer records from the CRM system**.\n\nLet me explain why:\n\n1. **No deletion capability**: The system API does not provide a function to delete customers. The available customer operations are:\n   - `customers_list` - List customers\n   - `customers_get` - Get customer details\n   - `customers_search` - Search customers\n\n   There is no `customers_delete` or similar function.\n\n2. **Data retention requirements**: Even if such functionality existed, company records (including customer data) must typically be retained for legal, financial, and audit purposes. Deleting customer records entirely could violate compliance requirements."

If this customer relationship has ended, you could work with Finance/IT to mark the account as \"inactive\" or \"closed\" in the system\n2. Contact IT & Digital department to discuss data archival options\n3.
