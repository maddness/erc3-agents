Draft\nWhen you first log time, it starts as a **draft**. This means the entry is saved but not yet finalized. You can still edit or correct draft entries freely.\n\n### 2. Submitted\nOnce you're confident your time entry is accurate, you submit it for review. **Submitted** entries are waiting for approval from a manager or project lead. You generally shouldn't edit submitted entries without retracting them first.\n\n### 3. Approved\nAfter review, approved entries are confirmed as accurate and ready for billing. **Approved** time entries have been verified and will be included in client invoices or internal reporting.\n\n### 4. Invoiced\nOnce time has been billed to the customer, it becomes **invoiced**. This is a final status indicating the work has been charged. Invoiced entries should not be modified.\n\n### 5. Voided\nIf a time entry was made in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries are not deleted—they remain in the system for audit purposes—but they are excluded from reports and billing.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Always double-check your hours before submitting\n- If you need to correct an approved or invoiced entry, contact your manager\n- Voided entries preserve the audit trail while removing the time from active calculations\n- Only authorized personnel can approve or void time entries\n"
