Every customer in the CRM has one of these phases assigned. The account manager keeps it up to date.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nThe starting point for any new lead.\n- We've just made contact (trade fair, referral, inbound request)\n- The customer is added to the CRM\n- No significant work has happened yet – just initial conversations\n\n### 2. Exploring\nEarly-stage relationship building.\n- First site visits and technical discussions\n- Initial lab suggestions or product recommendations\n- Maybe some early trials, but nothing formal yet\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is a real, working customer relationship.\n- Formal projects are opened in the project registry\n- Trials, custom formulations, or regular supply are underway\n- Significant time is being logged against the customer and their projects\n\n### 4. Paused\nRelationship on hold, but not lost.\n- No current activity, but we haven't walked away\n- Customer stays in CRM – we might pick things up again later\n\n### 5. Archived\nRelationship closed.\n- No realistic future business expected\n- Customer record stays for historical reference, but we're not pursuing it\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is opened** in the project registry (for trials, custom formulations, or supply schemes)\n2. **Significant internal time starts being logged** against that customer and their projects\n3. **The relationship becomes structured** – not just conversations, but actual work being done\n\nIn simple terms: once we're spending real effort and tracking it in our systems, the customer is \"active.\"\n\n## Who Updates Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping the deal phase accurate. Updates typically happen after pipeline review meetings. The rule is: reflect the true state of the relationship, not wishful thinking.\n\n---\n\n*For more details, see the full CRM documentation and sales process guides in the wiki.*\n"
