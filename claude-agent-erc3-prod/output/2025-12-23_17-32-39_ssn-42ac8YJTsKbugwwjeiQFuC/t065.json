This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or correct draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nOnce you're confident your time entry is accurate, you **submit** it for approval. At this stage, the entry is waiting for a manager or project lead to review it.\n\n### Approved\nWhen a manager reviews and confirms the entry is correct, it becomes **approved**. This means the hours are verified and ready to be included in client invoicing.\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved entries are included on a client invoice, they are marked as **invoiced**. This indicates the work has been billed to the customer.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was logged in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries are not counted toward project hours or billing. Use this status to correct mistakes rather than deleting records, so we maintain a complete audit trail.\n\n## Summary\n\n| Status | Meaning |\n|--------|---------|\n| Draft | Entered but not yet submitted |\n| Submitted | Waiting for manager approval |\n| Approved | Verified and ready for billing |\n| Invoiced | Included on a client invoice |\n| Voided | Cancelled/invalid entry |\n\n---\n*For questions about time tracking, contact your project lead or HR.*\n"
