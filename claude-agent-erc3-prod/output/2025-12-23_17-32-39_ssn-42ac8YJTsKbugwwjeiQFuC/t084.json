The system does not support customer deletion functionality.\n\nI found the customer \"EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs\" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) in the system with status \"active\" in the Netherlands. However, the available operations for customers are limited to:\n- Listing customers\n- Searching customers\n- Getting customer details\n\nThere is no customer delete or removal function available. This is likely by design, as customer records often need to be retained for legal, financial, and audit purposes.\n\n**Alternatives to consider:**\n1. Contact IT or a system administrator to perform the deletion directly in the database\n2. If the goal is to mark the customer as inactive rather than delete, you may need to work with IT to update the deal_phase or status\n3. Consult with Finance/Legal about record retention requirements before deletion\n\nWould you like me to help with something else regarding this customer?",
