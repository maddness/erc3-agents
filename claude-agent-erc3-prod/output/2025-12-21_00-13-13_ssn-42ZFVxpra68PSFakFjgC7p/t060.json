They help everyone in the company understand where we stand with each customer – from initial contact to active business or closed relationship.\n\nThink of deal phases as a simple way to answer: \"How far along are we with this customer?\"\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\n**What it means:** We've just identified a potential customer – maybe we met them at a trade fair, received a referral, or they reached out to us.\n\n**At this stage:**\n- Customer is added to the CRM\n- We have basic contact information\n- No real discussions have happened yet\n\n### 2. Exploring\n**What it means:** We're in early conversations and getting to know each other.\n\n**At this stage:**\n- First visits have taken place\n- Basic technical discussions are happening\n- We might be making early product recommendations\n- Lab may be giving initial suggestions\n- No formal projects have been created yet\n\n### 3. Active\n**What it means:** Real work is happening. This is an actual business relationship with committed resources.\n\n**At this stage:**\n- Formal projects exist in the project registry\n- Trials, custom formulations, or supply schemes are underway\n- Team members are logging significant time to customer projects\n- Regular business activity is occurring\n\n### 4. Paused\n**What it means:** The relationship isn't dead, but nothing is currently happening.\n\n**At this stage:**\n- Projects may be on hold\n- Customer might be busy with other priorities\n- We haven't lost them – just waiting for the right time\n\n### 5. Archived\n**What it means:** The relationship is closed. Either we completed what we set out to do, or there's no realistic future business.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nThis is one of the most important transitions in our sales process. A customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is created** in the project registry\n2. **The project is linked** to the customer\n3. **Internal resources are committed** – people start logging time against the project\n\nIn simple terms: **exploring** means we're just talking; **active** means we're actually doing work.\n\n### Practical Example\n\n| Stage | What's Happening |\n|-------|------------------|\n| Exploring | Sales visits the customer, discusses their coating needs, brings back samples for the lab to look at informally |\n| → Transition point | Account manager creates a project called \"Acme Corp – Powder Coating Trial\" in the project registry |\n| Active | R&D chemists are formulating, application specialists are planning field tests, everyone is logging time to the project |\n\n## Who Manages Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping deal phases up to date. This typically happens during pipeline review meetings where the team discusses the current state of each customer relationship.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAccurate deal phases help us:\n- Prioritise our efforts on the right customers\n- Generate meaningful sales reports\n- Give correct answers when people ask about customer status\n- Plan resource allocation across projects\n\n**Golden rule:** Update the deal phase to reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If we're still just talking, it's 'exploring'. Only move to 'active' when real project work has begun.\n"

Paused\n**What it means:** The relationship isn't dead, but nothing is currently happening.\n\n**At this stage:**\n- Projects may be on hold\n- Customer might be busy with other priorities\n- We haven't lost them – just waiting for the right time\n\n### 5. Archived\n**What it means:** The relationship is closed. Either we completed what we set out to do, or there's no realistic future business.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nThis is one of the most important transitions in our sales process. A customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is created** in the project registry\n2. **The project is linked** to the customer\n3. **Internal resources are committed** – people start logging time against the project\n\nIn simple terms: **exploring** means we're just talking; **active** means we're actually doing work.\n\n### Practical Example\n\n| Stage | What's Happening |\n|-------|------------------|\n| Exploring | Sales visits the customer, discusses their coating needs, brings back samples for the lab to look at informally |\n| → Transition point | Account manager creates a project called \"Acme Corp – Powder Coating Trial\" in the project registry |\n| Active | R&D chemists are formulating, application specialists are planning field tests, everyone is logging time to the project |\n\n## Who Manages Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping deal phases up to date. This typically happens during pipeline review meetings where the team discusses the current state of each customer relationship.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAccurate deal phases help us:\n- Prioritise our efforts on the right customers\n- Generate meaningful sales reports\n- Give correct answers when people ask about customer status\n- Plan resource allocation across projects\n\n**Golden rule:** Update the deal phase to reflect reality, not wishful thinking. If we're still just talking, it's 'exploring'. Only move to 'active' when real project work has begun.\n"
