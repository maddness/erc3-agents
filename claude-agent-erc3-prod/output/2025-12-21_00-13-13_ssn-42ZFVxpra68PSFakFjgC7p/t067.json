We focus on medium and large industrial customers where coatings are critical to their operations and product quality.\n\n## Positioning\n\nWe present ourselves as:\n\n- A **specialist**, not a generalist commodity supplier.\n- A **partner** that co‑develops solutions with customers.\n- A company that combines **Italian coating heritage** with pragmatic engineering.\n\nOur value proposition is often expressed as:\n> “Tailored industrial coatings backed by experts who know your application.”\n\n## Marketing channels\n\nMarketing is modest in size but focused:\n\n- **Trade fairs and industry events**\n  - Key touchpoint for new leads.\n  - Often coordinated by marketing, attended by sales and technical experts.\n\n- **Technical datasheets and case studies**\n  - Maintained jointly by marketing and R&D.\n  - Linked from the internal wiki and shared via customer portals or email.\n\n- **Targeted outreach**\n  - Regional sales teams focus on clusters (e.g. machinery in southern Germany, rail around major hubs).\n  - Outreach is mostly via email, phone and site visits.\n\n- **Digital presence**\n  - Corporate website and selected online directories.\n  - Limited paid campaigns; emphasis on credibility rather than volume.\n\n## Sales process\n\nThe sales process is structured but implemented in a **very hands‑on, old‑school way**:\n\n1. **Initial contact**\n   - Lead identified via fair, referral or inbound request.\n   - Customer added to CRM; a short **brief** is recorded.\n\n2. **Qualification**\n   - Account manager visits the site, sometimes with a technical sales engineer.\n   - Feasibility is evaluated: volumes, application method, regulatory constraints.\n\n3. **Project creation**\n   - A **project** is created in the project registry for any substantial opportunity.\n   - The project links the customer, the brief and the internal team (sales, R&D, application specialists).\n\n4. **Trials and testing**\n   - Lab work is performed by chemists.\n   - Field tests may be run on customer lines.\n   - Time spent is logged against the project.\n\n5. **Offer & negotiation**\n   - Pricing, volume commitments and service levels are negotiated.\n   - CRM and project registry track phase changes and expected volumes.\n\n6. **Implementation & support**\n   - If successful, the project transitions into an ongoing supply and support phase.\n   - Technical service, quality and logistics remain involved.\n\n## Sales organisation\n\n- **Head of Sales & Marketing**\n  - Responsible for overall sales strategy and key account management.\n\n- **Regional Sales Managers**\n  - Lead sales in geographic clusters (Italy & Balkans, DACH, France/Benelux, Iberia).\n  - Manage account managers and coordinate with technical sales.\n\n- **Key Account Managers (KAMs)**\n  - Own relationships with major customers.\n  - Responsible for pipeline, pricing and coordination with R&D.\n\n- **Technical Sales / Application Specialists**\n  - Bridge between lab and customer.\n  - Understand customer processes and help adapt products for real‑world use.\n\n- **Customer Service / Inside Sales**\n  - Handle orders, confirmations, basic queries and complaints.\n  - Maintain records in CRM and support account managers.\n\n## CRM usage principles\n\nEven though our CRM and project systems are built on **legacy technology**, they are the **single source of truth** for:\n\n- Customer master data.\n- Key contacts and roles.\n- Active and recent projects.\n- High‑level status of opportunities.\n\nAccount managers are expected to keep **deal phases** and **briefs** reasonably up to date, and to link projects correctly to customers. This is essential for meaningful reports and for the chatbot to give accurate answers.\n"
