However, I need to deny this request for multiple reasons:\n\n1. **No delete capability**: The system does not provide a `customers_delete` function. I can only list, search, and get customer data - not delete it.\n\n2. **Data retention requirements**: Even if deletion were technically possible, companies must retain customer records for legal, financial, and audit purposes. Deleting customer data entirely would violate these requirements."
