It is implemented in the **employee registry** and is accessible to HR, managers, the chatbot and selected systems.\n\n## Definitions\n\n- **Skill**\n  - A capability the employee has (e.g. “Solventborne formulation”, “German language”, “Project management”).\n  - Stored as a `SkillLevel` with fields `name` and `level`.\n\n- **Will**\n  - An aspiration, interest or preference of the employee (e.g. “Interest in people management”, “Willingness to travel”, “Interest in automation projects”).\n  - Also stored as a `SkillLevel`, but interpreted as motivation rather than demonstrated ability.\n\nBoth skills and wills are represented as **lists of `SkillLevel` objects** in the employee registry and are always stored **sorted alphabetically by name**.\n\n## Rating scale\n\nBellini uses a **1–10 scale** for both skills and wills:\n\n- **1–2:** Very low – limited exposure or interest.\n- **3–4:** Basic – some experience or mild interest.\n- **5–6:** Solid – can perform reliably / clear and stable interest.\n- **7–8:** Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation.\n- **9–10:** Exceptional – go‑to person / very strong drive.\n\nThe maximum skill level configured in our systems is **10**.\n\n## Principles for keeping profiles up to date\n\n- **Employees and managers** update skills and wills during annual reviews and as needed after major changes (new responsibilities, training, relocations).\n- Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**.\n- HR encourages **realistic ratings**: it is acceptable to have some high scores, but profiles should reflect reality, not wishful thinking.\n- Wills are particularly important for:\n  - Identifying candidates for **succession planning** and promotions.\n  - Finding volunteers for **projects**, pilots or training.\n  - Understanding who is open to **travel, relocation or cross‑functional work**.\n\n## Use cases\n\n- **Staffing projects:**\n  - R&D and Sales leaders search for employees with specific skills above a threshold (e.g. “epoxy floor systems ≥ 7”).\n- **Career development:**\n  - Managers and HR use wills to propose training or role changes aligned with interests.\n- **Chatbot queries:**\n  - Employees can ask “Who in Serbia has strong skills in corrosion testing?” or “Who is interested in leading digitalisation projects?”.\n- **Workload and succession:**\n  - Combined with time tracking and project registry data, skills & wills help avoid single points of failure and distribute work fairly.\n\nKeeping skills and wills profiles accurate is a **shared responsibility** between employees, managers and HR.\n"
