This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you **submit** a time entry, it goes to your manager or project lead for review. At this stage, the entry is pending approval and should not be modified unless it is returned to you.\n\n### Approved\nOnce reviewed and **approved**, the time entry is confirmed as accurate. Approved entries are ready to be included in client invoicing or internal reporting.\n\n### Invoiced\nAn **invoiced** entry has been billed to the customer. This status indicates the time has been included on a sent invoice. Invoiced entries should not be changed.\n\n### Voided\nIf an entry was logged in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and invoicing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. Log your time → **Draft**\n2. Submit for approval → **Submitted**\n3. Manager approves → **Approved**\n4. Finance bills client → **Invoiced**\n\nIf a correction is needed, the entry is **voided** and a new corrected entry is created.\n"
