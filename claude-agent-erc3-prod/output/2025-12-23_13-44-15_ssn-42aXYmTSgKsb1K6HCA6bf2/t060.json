          "content": "# Deal Phases in Our CRM – A Plain Language Guide\n\nThis document explains how deal phases work in Bellini's CRM system and when customers move between phases.\n\n## What Are Deal Phases?\n\nDeal phases are labels we use to track where a customer stands in their commercial relationship with us. Every customer in the CRM has one deal phase that reflects the current state of that relationship.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nThe customer is brand new to us. We've just identified them—maybe from a trade fair, a referral, or they reached out to us. At this stage, we're simply aware they exist and might be a fit.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nWe're getting to know the customer. This means:\n- First visits to their site\n- Basic technical discussions\n- Early lab suggestions or product recommendations\n\nThe relationship is promising but nothing formal has started yet.\n\n### 3. Active\nThe customer has become a real, working relationship. This is when:\n- **Formal projects** are opened in the project registry (for trials, custom formulations, or supply agreements)\n- **Significant time** is being logged against the customer and their projects\n- There's ongoing, regular business or active development work\n\n### 4. Paused\nWe had activity with this customer, but nothing is happening right now. They're not lost—the relationship is just on hold. We keep them in the CRM because there may be future opportunities.\n\n### 5. Archived\nThe relationship is effectively over. This could mean we lost the business, they went with a competitor, or there's simply no realistic chance of future work. We keep the record for history, but don't expect activity.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when the relationship becomes concrete and formal. The key trigger is:\n\n**Opening a formal project in the project registry.**\n\nThis typically happens when:\n- We start official trials for the customer\n- We begin developing a custom formulation for them\n- We establish a supply scheme or ongoing support arrangement\n- We start logging significant internal time to their work\n\nIn simple terms: if we're just talking and testing the waters, they're still **exploring**. Once we create a project and start tracking real work, they become **active**.\n\n## Who Manages Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** assigned to the customer is responsible for keeping the deal phase up to date. Phases are typically reviewed and adjusted during pipeline review meetings.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nAccurate deal phases help us:\n- Prioritise our sales efforts\n- Generate meaningful pipeline reports\n- Give accurate answers when people ask \"how many active customers do we have?\" or \"which customers are we exploring?\"\n\nKeep phases realistic—they should reflect the true state of the relationship, not wishful thinking.\n"
