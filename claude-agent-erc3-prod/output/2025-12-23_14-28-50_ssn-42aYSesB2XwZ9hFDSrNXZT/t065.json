This means it has been logged but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you submit a time entry, it moves to **submitted** status. This indicates the entry is ready for manager review and approval. Submitted entries should not be modified without a good reason.\n\n### Approved\nOnce a manager reviews and approves a time entry, it becomes **approved**. Approved entries are considered final and accurate records of work performed. They are ready to be included in invoicing.\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved time has been billed to the customer, the entry moves to **invoiced** status. Invoiced entries represent work that has already been charged to clients and should not be changed.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be marked as **voided**. Voided entries remain in the system for audit purposes but are excluded from reports and billing calculations.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Log time** → Entry created as Draft\n2. **Submit for review** → Entry becomes Submitted\n3. **Manager approves** → Entry becomes Approved\n4. **Finance bills client** → Entry becomes Invoiced\n\nIf an error is found at any stage, the entry can be voided and a corrected entry created.\n"
