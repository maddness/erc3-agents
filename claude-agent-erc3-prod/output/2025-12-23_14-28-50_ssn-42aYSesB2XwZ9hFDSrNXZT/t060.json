They help us prioritize our efforts and give everyone visibility into what's happening with each account.\n\n## The Four Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nThis is where it all starts. A potential customer has been identified—maybe from a trade fair, a referral, or an inbound request. We've added them to the CRM as a Company record, but we haven't engaged in any real discussions yet.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nWe've made first contact and are having initial conversations. This includes site visits, basic technical discussions, and early product recommendations. We're figuring out if there's a fit between what they need and what we can offer—but no formal project has been opened yet.\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is where real work begins. We've opened one or more formal projects in the project registry for things like trials, custom formulations, or supply agreements. Internal teams (sales, R&D, application specialists) are logging significant time against these projects. The relationship has moved from \"let's talk\" to \"let's build something together.\"\n\n### 4. Paused or Archived\nProjects can be paused (no current activity but might resume) or archived (closed out). The customer stays in the CRM with a status note like \"Dormant\" or \"Key account,\" so we don't lose the relationship history.\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n1. **A formal project is created** in the project registry\n2. **The project is linked** to the customer\n3. **Internal teams start logging time** against that project\n\nIn other words, once we've committed real resources—lab work, field tests, technical consultations—and that work is being tracked in a formal project, the deal phase should be updated to \"active.\"\n\n## Who Updates the Deal Phase?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping deal phases current. This typically happens after pipeline review meetings where the team discusses account status and next steps.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nKeeping deal phases accurate helps us:\n- Generate meaningful sales reports\n- Prioritize which accounts need attention\n- Give accurate answers when people ask about customer status\n- Avoid confusion about where relationships actually stand\n\nRemember: our CRM may be legacy technology, but it's our single source of truth for customer data.\n"
