This means the entry has been created but not yet submitted for review. You can still edit draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're satisfied with a time entry, you **submit** it. This sends the entry forward for approval. Submitted entries are pending review by a manager or approver.\n\n### Approved\nOnce a manager reviews and accepts a submitted entry, it becomes **approved**. Approved entries are confirmed as accurate and ready for billing purposes.\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved time has been included on a customer invoice, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This indicates the work has been billed to the customer.\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry contains an error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. Voided entries are not deleted—they remain in the system for audit purposes—but they no longer count toward project hours or billing.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Draft** → Employee creates and saves time entry\n2. **Submitted** → Employee submits for approval\n3. **Approved** → Manager confirms the entry\n4. **Invoiced** → Finance includes in customer billing\n\nAt any point before invoicing, an entry can be **voided** if corrections are needed.\n"
