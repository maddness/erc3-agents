They said they \"only worked 6\" but then asked to \"create new copy with 8 hours.\" This seems contradictory. However, my instructions say: \"CRITICAL: Execute EXACTLY as user requested - if they say 'create with 8 hours' then use 8, even if they earlier mentioned working 6. Do NOT question apparent contradictions - just execute literally.\"\n\nSo I will void the entry and create a new one with 8 hours as explicitly requested.\n\nLet me check if there's a time_void function available.

Usually paired with a correcting entry.\n\nAfter approval, employees cannot change entries directly; corrections require specific processes to ensure an audit trail.\n\n## Why we track time\n\n- **Customer profitability**\n  - Understand how much effort is invested in supporting each customer.\n- **Project costing**\n  - Analyse efforts spent on different project types and stages.\n- **Workload monitoring**\n  - Identify overloaded employees or teams.\n- **Internal improvements**\n  - Quantify time spent on non‑customer initiatives (e.g. training, digital projects).\n\n## Usage expectations\n\n- Employees should log time **at least weekly**, ideally daily.\n- Use **projects** consistently:\n  - Customer work → customer projects.\n  - Internal initiatives → internal projects (e.g. “IT – Chatbot Pilot 2025”).\n- Notes should be concise but informative (what was done, not just “meeting”).\n- Project leads can log entries for the team members in draft mode. They are NOT allowed to submit entries for them.\n\n## Reporting and summaries\n\nThe system can aggregate and summarise time in different ways:\n\n- **By project and customer**\n  - Hours, billable vs non‑billable, number of distinct employees.\n- **By employee**\n  - Total hours, distribution between customer work and internal activities.\n\nThe chatbot can answer questions like:\n\n- “How many hours did we spend on Customer X last quarter?”\n- “Show time spent by Sara Romano on project P‑2025‑017 this year.”\n- “Which employees logged more than 45 hours in the past week?”\n\nCorrect and timely time logging is essential for good data and fair decisions.\n\n## Workload estimation\n\nNote, that when estimating workload (e.g. who is busiest or non-busiest), we rely on workload time slices via Project registry."
