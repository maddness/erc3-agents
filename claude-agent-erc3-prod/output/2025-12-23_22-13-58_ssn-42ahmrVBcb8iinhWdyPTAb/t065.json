This is a work-in-progress entry that hasn't been submitted yet. You can edit or delete draft entries freely.\n\n### Submitted\nOnce you're happy with your time entry, you **submit** it for review. Submitted entries are waiting for manager approval. You typically shouldn't edit submitted entries without withdrawing them first.\n\n### Approved\nAn **approved** entry has been reviewed and confirmed by a manager. This means the hours are officially recorded and ready for billing. Approved entries should not be changed without good reason.\n\n### Invoiced\nWhen time has been **invoiced**, it means the hours have been billed to the customer. These entries are locked and represent completed financial transactions.\n\n### Voided\nA **voided** entry is one that has been cancelled. Use this status to correct mistakes rather than deleting entries, as voided entries maintain an audit trail. Voided hours are not counted or billed.\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Draft** → Employee logs time\n2. **Submitted** → Employee sends for approval\n3. **Approved** → Manager confirms the entry\n4. **Invoiced** → Finance bills the customer\n\nAt any point, an entry can be **voided** if it contains errors or was entered incorrectly.\n"
