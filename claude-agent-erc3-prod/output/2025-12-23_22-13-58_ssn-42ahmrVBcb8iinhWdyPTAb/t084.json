      "I found the customer \"EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs\" in our system. However, I need to inform you that **I cannot delete this customer from the CRM**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **No deletion capability**: The CRM system does not have a customer deletion function available. The available customer operations are limited to listing, searching, and viewing customer details.\n\n2. **Data retention requirements**: Company records, including customer data, must typically be retained for legal, financial, and audit purposes. Deleting customer records could violate regulatory compliance requirements.\n\n3. **Active customer status**: This customer currently shows as \"active\" in deal phase, which suggests there may be ongoing business relationships or historical transaction data that should be preserved.\n\n**Recommended alternatives:**\n- If you need to mark this customer as inactive, please contact IT or the system administrator to update the customer status\n- If there's a data privacy request (e.g., GDPR), this should be escalated to HR and Legal for proper handling through official channels"
