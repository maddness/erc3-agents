          "content": "# Deal Phases in Our CRM – A Plain Language Guide\n\nThis document explains how deal phases work in our CRM system and when to move a customer from one phase to another.\n\n## What Are Deal Phases?\n\nDeal phases are simple labels that describe where we stand in our commercial relationship with a customer. They help everyone in the company understand at a glance whether a customer is a new lead, an active partner, or somewhere in between.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n| Phase | What It Means |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **Idea** | A brand new lead. We've had an early conversation – maybe met them at a trade fair, received a referral, or got an inbound enquiry. We don't know yet if this will go anywhere. |\n| **Exploring** | We're digging deeper. This might include site visits, feasibility discussions, lab trials, or early testing. There's real interest on both sides, but no regular business yet. |\n| **Active** | Ongoing projects and regular business. The customer is buying from us or we have substantial work underway with them. This is a live, working relationship. |\n| **Paused** | The relationship has gone quiet. There's no current activity, but we haven't lost the customer – they might come back. |\n| **Archived** | The relationship is closed. Either we've mutually parted ways, or there's no realistic chance of future business. |\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **Exploring** to **Active** when:\n\n1. **A real project starts** – Not just trials or testing, but an actual project where we're doing ongoing work for the customer (formulation, supply, technical support).\n\n2. **Regular business begins** – The customer starts placing orders, or we have a confirmed supply agreement.\n\n3. **The relationship becomes operational** – It's no longer about \"maybe we'll work together\" but \"we are working together.\"\n\n### Practical Examples\n\n- ✅ Move to Active: Customer has approved a coating after trials and placed their first production order.\n- ✅ Move to Active: We've signed a framework agreement and are now supplying product regularly.\n- ✅ Move to Active: A substantial development project kicks off with committed resources on both sides.\n- ❌ Stay in Exploring: We've run lab tests but the customer is still evaluating options.\n- ❌ Stay in Exploring: There's interest and conversations, but no commitment yet.\n\n## Who Updates Deal Phases?\n\nThe **Account Manager** assigned to the customer is responsible for keeping deal phases accurate and up to date. This is important because:\n\n- Management uses deal phases for pipeline reviews\n- Finance uses them for forecasting\n- The chatbot relies on them to give accurate answers\n\n**Golden rule:** Reflect the true state of the relationship, not wishful thinking.\n\n---\n\n*For more details, see the full CRM documentation in `systems/crm.md` and the sales process overview in `business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md`.*\n"
