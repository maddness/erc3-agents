We focus on **custom solutions** for medium and large industrial customers rather than commodity paint.\n\n## What we produce\n\nWe specialise in coatings for:\n\n- **Industrial machinery and equipment**\n- **Automotive and commercial vehicle components**\n- **Rail and rolling stock**\n- **Food & beverage production facilities** (food‑contact compliant systems)\n- **Industrial flooring and structural steel**\n\nTypical product families include:\n\n- High‑temperature resistant coatings (e.g. ovens, exhaust systems, engine components)\n- Anti‑corrosion systems (primers + intermediates + topcoats for steel structures)\n- Chemical‑resistant floor systems (often multi‑layer)\n- Hygienic and food‑safe coatings for tanks, pipes and process lines\n- Decorative but durable OEM topcoats with custom colours and textures\n\n## How we work with customers\n\nBellini is not a “catalogue-only” paint vendor. For many key accounts we work through a **project model**:\n\n1. Sales identifies a need or opportunity.\n2. A **project** is opened in the project registry and linked to the customer in the CRM.\n3. R&D develops or adapts a formulation.\n4. Application specialists run lab and field trials.\n5. Once approved, the solution moves into ongoing supply with technical support.\n\nThis project-centric way of working is deeply integrated with our internal systems (CRM, project registry, time tracking) and reflects how we think about value: **long‑term partnerships built around tailored solutions.**\n\n## Strategic focus\n\nOver the next decade, Bellini aims to:\n\n- Deepen relationships with **key OEMs** and strategic industrial customers.\n- Expand our presence in **Central and Eastern Europe** using the Serbian plant as a cost-effective base.\n- Modernise how we use data and systems, while **preserving the reliability** of our legacy Progress OpenEdge backbone.\n- Support more **sustainable and lower‑VOC formulations** in line with regulation and customer demand.\n"
