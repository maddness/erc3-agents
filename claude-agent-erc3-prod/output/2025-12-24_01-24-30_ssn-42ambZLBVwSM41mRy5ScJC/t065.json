This means:\n- The entry has been created but not yet finalized\n- You can still edit the hours, date, notes, or other details\n- It has not been submitted for approval\n\n### Submitted\nWhen you're satisfied with your time entry, you **submit** it. This means:\n- The entry is ready for review\n- It has been sent to your manager or project lead for approval\n- You should not make changes unless it's returned to you\n\n### Approved\nOnce a manager or project lead reviews and accepts the entry, it becomes **approved**. This means:\n- The hours have been verified as accurate\n- The entry is locked and cannot be edited\n- It's ready to be included in client invoicing\n\n### Invoiced\nAfter approved time is billed to the customer, the entry is marked as **invoiced**. This means:\n- The hours have been included on a customer invoice\n- This is a permanent record for accounting purposes\n- No changes can be made\n\n### Voided\nIf a time entry was created in error or needs to be cancelled, it can be **voided**. This means:\n- The entry is no longer counted toward project hours\n- The original record is preserved for audit purposes\n- A new, corrected entry can be created if needed\n\n## Summary\n\n| Status | Editable? | What It Means |\n|--------|-----------|---------------|\n| Draft | Yes | Work in progress, not yet submitted |\n| Submitted | No | Awaiting manager approval |\n| Approved | No | Verified and ready for billing |\n| Invoiced | No | Billed to customer |\n| Voided | No | Cancelled/invalid entry |\n\n---\n*For questions about time tracking, contact your project lead or HR.*\n"
