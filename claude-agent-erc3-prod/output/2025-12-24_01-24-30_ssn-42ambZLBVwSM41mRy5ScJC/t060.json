They help the team track progress and prioritise work. Every customer in the CRM has a deal phase, which is kept up to date by their account manager.\n\n## The Four Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\nThis is the starting point. A customer contact has been identified—maybe from a trade fair, a referral, or an inbound request. We've added them to the CRM, but there's been no real engagement yet.\n\n### 2. Exploring\nWe've started talking to the customer. This includes first visits, initial technical discussions, and early product recommendations or lab suggestions. We're getting to know their needs, but nothing formal has been set up yet.\n\n### 3. Active\nThis is where real work begins. The customer moves to \"active\" when we open a formal project in the project registry—whether that's for trials, custom formulations, or a supply arrangement. At this stage, the team is logging significant time against the customer and their projects.\n\n### 4. Paused or Archived\nIf a project goes quiet, it may be marked as \"paused\" (on hold for now) or \"archived\" (closed out). The customer record stays in the CRM with a status note like \"Curious but cautious\", \"Key account\", or \"Dormant\".\n\n## When Does a Customer Move from 'Exploring' to 'Active'?\n\nA customer moves from **exploring** to **active** when:\n\n- A **formal project** is created in the project registry (not just casual discussions)\n- The project involves real work: trials, testing, custom formulations, or planning a supply scheme\n- The internal team (sales, R&D, application specialists) starts **logging time** to that project\n\nIn simple terms: once we're investing real effort and tracking it in the project system, the deal is active.\n\n## Who Updates Deal Phases?\n\nThe **account manager** is responsible for keeping deal phases current. This usually happens during pipeline review meetings. Accurate phases are essential for reports and for the company chatbot to give correct information.\n\n---\n\n*For more details, see the full Sales Process documentation in the Marketing & Sales Approach wiki.*\n"
